# Password-Generator

## Description

This webpage contains a random password generator. When the user presses the "Generate Password" button, they are asked how long they would like their password to be. They will be asked this until they input a valid number between 8 and 128. After selecting a valid password length, they are asked to choose which types of characters they would like included in their password, with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters as their options. If they do not select any of these, all of them with be automatically selected. The randomly generated password will then be displayed in the box above the "Generate Password" button.
